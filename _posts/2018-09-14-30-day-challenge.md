Before I go to military service I thought I could plan for my life as I did before, but the conditions differed.
> Everything not going as you want.

I've been confused and clatter, thus I decided to make a right way to mine. I read a lot of article and blog posts and watch [Ted Talks](https://www.ted.com) about life changing and personal planning methods like [IPP](https://www.dds.ca.gov/RC/RCipp.cfm) and [PDP](https://www.managers.org.uk/knowledge-bank/personal-development-planning), but I felt everything were wrong  yet.

Social medias, economical crisis and family problems, all of them puts me under pressure and takes my focus. Once day I read an [article](https://shop.thebettyrocker.com/30-day-challenge-meal-plan/) about 30 Day Challenge for health. Actually this challenge was for those who wanted lose their weight and make their diet and habits better. There was a quote that said : 
> It takes 21 days to form a new habit (or 30 days or some other magic number).

I thought to myself that I can make this challenge more fit and customize, then I made a list of things I had to do and not to do for 30 day. 
One of important point of this challenge is grab a friend and do this with each other, so it's help you to be more engage to this challenge.

**Here is the list of 30 Day Challenge items :**

* Programming Just Use POMODORO Technique.
